## Project:  Optical efficiency calculation and layout optimization of tower heliostat field
塔式定日镜场光效计算及布局优化

1.	Construct the heliostat tracking control model based on law of light reflection.
2. To obtain the optical efficiency, we calculate the atmospheric transmittance, cosine efficiency, shadow shielding efficiency and collector cutoff efficiency
3. For 3d-modelling, we use optical cone coordinate system and Monte Carlo ray tracing method. 
4. For layout optimization, we use fixed step size search and heuristic algorithm of particle swarm to derive the best location of the absorption tower.
