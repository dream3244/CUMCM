### Project: Chemical Composition Analysis and Classification of Ancient Glass Based on Multivariate Statistical Analysis 

1.	Data preprocessing: Filter the valid data and create dummy variables for glass attributes.
2.	Analyze the correlation between the weathering state of ancient glass and its attributes using the Multiple Logistic Regression model based on Lasso Regression.
3.	Explore the statistical law of chemical composition with weathering states by Descriptive Statistical Analysis, and apply the composition ratio to weathered sample points for prediction.
4.	Build an improved Decision Tree model (CART) model for glass classification and interpret the result based on literature.
5. Divide subclasses using Systematic Clustering by SPSS and visualize sample points on the 2-d plane by the PCA method for sensitivity analysis.
6. Classify the eight unlabeled glass samples leveraging the two models above. Perform sensitivity analysis by drawing the ROC curve and utilizing the partial derivative. 
7. Analyze the relationship between two chemical components using Spearman Correlation Coefficient, and investigate the correlation in a group of variables by using the Variance Expansion Factor and Factor Analysis method. Analyzed the disparities between the two glass categories by Coefficient Heatmaps. 





## TipDM Cup
### The 10th  “TipDM Cup” Data Mining Challenge	
### Project: Analysis and Prediction of Electricity Load Based on Long short-term memory (LSTM) model

1. Use Prophet and LSTM models to predict the fluctuation of electricity load at intervals of 15 minutes and 24 hours respectively. Sum up the two figures to obtain the final 15-minutes-interval prediction.
2. Employ Pettitt、SNHT、BuishandU and Man-Kendall methods for mutation detection and select the MK model. Perform the MK-mutation point test on the data and interpret the results.
3. Predict the trend of future electricity load consumption in 4 main types of industries and make suggestions respectively.


## 2021 HITsz Mathematical Modeling Contest 	
### 2021 HITsz Mathematical Modeling Contest
### Project: Motion Segmentation in MEMS Inertial Sensors Based on Moving Average Filter


1. Data preprocessing: reduce the noise of the data using the Moving Average method.
2. Set an appropriate threshold for motion detection based on the weighted average method.
3. build the model for motion segmentation, which can adjust local extremums according to the length of the sliding window.
4. Determine the weights for acceleration and velocity. 
5. make predictions of the start and stops points for each motion.
