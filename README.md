### Project: Chemical Composition Analysis and Classification of Ancient Glass Based on Multivariate Statistical Analysis 

	Data preprocessing: Filter the valid data and create dummy variables for glass attributes.
	Analyze the correlation between the weathering state of ancient glass and its attributes using the Multiple Logistic Regression model based on Lasso Regression.
	Explore the statistical law of chemical composition with weathering states by Descriptive Statistical Analysis, and apply the composition ratio to weathered sample points for prediction.
	Build an improved Decision Tree model (CART) model for glass classification and interpret the result based on literature.
	Divide subclasses using Systematic Clustering by SPSS and visualize sample points on the 2-d plane by the PCA method for sensitivity analysis.
	Classify the eight unlabeled glass samples leveraging the two models above. Perform sensitivity analysis by drawing the ROC curve and utilizing the partial derivative. 
	Analyze the relationship between two chemical components using Spearman Correlation Coefficient, and investigate the correlation in a group of variables by using the Variance Expansion Factor and Factor Analysis method. Analyzed the disparities between the two glass categories by Coefficient Heatmaps.
